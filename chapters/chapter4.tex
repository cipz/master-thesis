	IoT is one of the most discussed topics in both academical and industrial research, as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:trends}.
	
	By contrast, mesh networks that use wireless technologies have been researched for decades, but have yet to be put into use in large scale.
	The correct definition of a \textit{wireless mesh network}, or WMN, is ``\textit{a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology instead of star topology}'' \cite{wms}.
	These types of network can make a difference when it comes to the interconnections in the IoT world.
	It is important that ``\textit{future IoT deployments need to focus on sustainability since huge centralized data centers (Cloud Computing) have become a critical part of the infrastructure}'' \cite{7968828}.
	
	This chapter anticipates the technical one, and shows some related projects from which the project has drawn inspiration.
	At first, challenges and solutions are presented for these WMS, alongside their advantages and disadvantages.
	Below are also presented some of the projects which have been made at various levels from homemade projects, to research, to the ones already available on the market.

	\section{Challenges and solutions of wireless mesh networks}
		
		% https://beyondroot.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-mesh-network-in-iot-an-experts-take/
		
		With new technologies, wireless mesh networking has reached a point of maturity and become ideal for IoT app developers. Besides, the elevation of connected homes and industry support on open-source resources has made mesh truly accessible and low-cost. They are also regarded as much more viable and real choice for commercial as well as industrial IoT apps. At the same time, it can render extra services in a system where extending a two-node connection is limited.
		
		There are various applications for this network topology:
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item Smart Cities: extending radio signals through campus grounds, business parks, parking garages, and other outdoor facilities
			Healthcare Equipment: monitoring and locating medical equipment. It can also serve as a backup for medical devices that always require to stay online. Thus, if one node crashes and loses connectivity, another node can step in to maintain the connection.
			\item Smart Home: You can track and manage temperature across your home using a wireless mesh network. You can also capture live data and adjust settings automatically by setting up one powered gateway, sensors, and mesh-enabled nodes in each room.
			\item Farming: Mesh networking is the best way to track sun exposure and water levels across the crops and fields. Additionally, you can create a cellular-connected IoT platform by building a mesh network across a whole acreage with the help of an IoT app development company.
		\end{itemize}

		Before choosing a mesh network topology it is important to evaluate aspects such as installation, device management and support.
		
		Energy management is an important factor as well, since the connected devices might not have a constant source of power.		
		Efficient transmission techniques and protocols that consider the amount of energy used, must be developed in order to optimally use the batteries on the devices		
		That is why there is a particular network topology, Low Power Wireless Area Network, which is focused on the interconnection of these devices
		
		Solutions to optimize the networks are being implemented both via hardware and software

		A WMS is a particular multihop network where data is sent from a node to another until it reaches its destination.

		Classic network topologies, such as the ones in Fig. \ref{img:network_topologies}, are not designed for iot networks and might not be able to meet the requirements for more dynamic devices.		
		These computer networks are not designed for low-powered devices such as remote sensors even these IoT devices are considered to be mini computers.
		The single point of failure nature of these networks makes the entire system extremely vulnerable when it comes to disasters or even difficult environment as the sensors may need to be deployed into some hardly reachable locations.Besides, the capacity of the central hub/router of the network can also limit the coverage of the service provided by IoT devices, and the range is also constrained by the same factors.
		
		An example of a multi hop wireless mesh network is VANET, a particular case of wireless multihop network, which has the constraint of fast topology changes due to the high node mobility With the increasing number of vehicles equipped with computing technologies and wireless communication devices, intervehicle communication is becoming a promising field of research, standardization, and development. VANETs enable a wide range of applications, such as prevention of collisions, safety, blind crossing, dynamic route scheduling, real-time traffic condition monitoring, etc. \cite{BADIS2015653}.
		
		Microsoft has also tried to apply mesh networking to normal internet household use \cite{bahl2009opportunistic}, however, given the improvements in telecom infrastructures and the advancement of fiber optics and internet via cable, the project has been abandoned.
		This shows how each network topology is better suited for particular scenarios.
		
		Compared to the example of microsoft's project, a vanet is more suited for a wms since the data transfered among cars is less than the one transfered among houses.

		\subsection{Advantages of WMS}
		
			Mesh Network for IoT devices offers enormous benefits that make it sought-after in enterprises and significant in an IoT app development company.
			Self-healing
			
			Like Shortest Path Bridging, Self-healing algorithm automatically chooses the best path to transfer data even if a few nodes lose connection. Specifically, it uses only those connections that are available and working to maintain the task.
			Self-configuring
			
			Due to auto-discovery, mesh networks are self-configuring in nature. Hence, the new nodes calibrate automatically and connect to the network without any previous setup. Consequently, network administration and expansion become easier in mesh networking.
			Scalability and Reliability
			
			In a mesh network, it is way easy to add or remove nodes without any efficiency issue. Usually, issues are in proportion to the devices. However, it is quite the opposite in the case of a mesh network. Adding nodes in a mesh network provides more routes in which data package can travel, which makes the network faster, reliable, and error-resistant.
			Cost Reduction
			
			Since mesh networks do not require internet connection, it consumes ultra-little energy. Meanwhile, sensors are pocket-friendly and long-lasting.
			
			Besides, IoT implementation reduces expenses in many other ways like better management, optimization of resources usage, and more.
		
		\subsection{Disasvantages of WMS}
		
			Drawbacks of Mesh Network in IoT
			
			Though there are ample benefits of a mesh network, it also comes with a few drawbacks. So, it is essential to gain in-depth knowledge of this network before deciding whether a mesh network is a perfect fit for you.
			Low Capacity
			
			Mesh network is the best way of sending small data packages. Unfortunately, it doesn’t perform well while transferring video file sized data.
			
			Still, if transferring a large amount of data is compulsory, then the Wi-Fi mesh network would be a better option.
			Latency
			
			Actively switching from one node to another can decelerate the data receiving process. However, it is not an issue when your system requires a package every few minutes or so. But, it might be not enough for a few systems.
			
			Conversely, a full mesh network can accelerate the data transfer by connecting every node to one another.
			Maintenance
			
			Due to the self-healing ability of the mesh network, finding a non-working node might be time-consuming. Also, we won’t come to know if a node is having an issue.
			
			On the other hand, mesh networks for IoT devices are established to make the IoT system smarter and more efficient. So, the nodes are less prone to crash.

					Meshtastic is an open-source hiking, pilot, skiing, Signal app-extending GPS mesh communicator.
					
					Meshtastic is a project that lets you use inexpensive (\$30 ish) GPS radios as an extensible, super long battery life mesh GPS communicator. These radios are great for hiking, skiing, paragliding - essentially any hobby where you don’t have reliable internet access. Each member of your private mesh can always see the location and distance of all other members and any text messages sent to your group chat.
					
					The radios automatically create a mesh to forward packets as needed, so everyone in the group can receive messages from even the furthest member. The radios will optionally work with your phone, but no phone is required.Our device code is here, our optional Android app is here.
					
					Prebuilt binaries are included on the github sites, but it is quite easy to build from source. Instructions are included in the README. No soldering is required, essentially - buy a \$30 radio and go. We'd love to have your help extending the project - it has been super fun to work on.

			\subsubsection{LoRaCTP}
			
				a ﬂexible protocol based
				on LoRa technology that allows for the transfer of “content” to
				large distances with very low energy. LoRaCTP provides all the
				necessary mechanisms to make LoRa reliable, by introducing a
				lightweight connection set-up and ideally allowing the sending
				of an as-long-as necessary data message.
			
				\begin{figure}[H]
					\centering
					\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{resources/img/chap4/loractp_packet}

					\caption[Flow of the establishment and interchange of data in LoRaCTP]{Flow of the establishment and interchange of data in LoRaCTP \cite{loractp}}
				\end{figure}
		
		By content we refer to a self-contained piece of data, like a
		JSON encoded message whose length is in principle unlimited.
		We tested out library with messages of up to 150 kbytes,
		as indicated in Section V. LoRaCTP is based on a unicast
		protocol adopting a classical stop-and-wait ARQ approach
		with a dynamic and adaptive value for the retransmission
		delay. The protocol ensures that information is not lost due to
		dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct
		order.
		
		Each packet is sent by using a three attempts scheme. That
		is, if after three attempts no ACK is received, we suppose
		that the channel is currently busy or too noisy and the content
		sending is dropped.
		
		On top of this ﬂow-control protocol there is a lightweight
		transport protocol that is used to establish a connection be-
		tween a master node, and a client node. Figure 3 shows a sim-
		ple sequence example. Basically the master device “listens”
		to incoming connections. Connections can be established in a
		unicast manner, by providing the address of the master device,
		or using an anycast approach, thus sending to the generic
		“00000000” address and thus receiving the reply from the
		close-by listening device. This possibility allows for a greater
		ﬂexibility in establishing dynamic topologys in rural areas, for
		example.

			\subsubsection{Off grid mesh devices: Sonnet and goTenna}
			
				Both of the following devices use LoRa to create a mesh network and have been designed for emergency off-grid communication, where cellular towers or land-line phones are not physically reachable.

					Sonnet\footnotemark, in Figure~\ref{img:sonnet}, connects to the smartphone via Wi-Fi allowing the user to send texts, voice messages, images, data, files and share GPS locations to any other Sonnet users up to several kilometers away, thanks to LoRa.
					This completely removes smartphones' dependency on cellular grid and other network infrastructure, and allows Sonnet to be used even when there is no cellular connectivity or Internet access.
				\end{minipage}		
				\footnotetext{~\url{www.sonnettech.com}}
			
				According to the product's Kickstarter page\footnote{ \url{www.kickstarter.com/profile/sonnet/created}} ``\textit{with Sonnet, data can be relayed up to 16 times to achieve a maximum range of 80 km (50 miles)}''.

				\newpage
				
				The goTenna\footnote{ \url{www.gotenna.com}}, in Figure~\ref{img:gotenna}, offers similar functions as the Sonnet, allowing to send text and GPS locations without the use of a cellphone with Internet connectivity.
				Mesh-networking allows to relay messages from a node to another until they reach destination.
				
				A compact and ruggedized kit, the goTenna Pro X, in Figure~\ref{img:gotenna_pro}, allows control for larger teams that operate in complex environments where it is not possible to be offline.
						
				As Sonnet, goTenna has raised the funds necessary to enter the market as a crowdfunded project on Kickstarter\footnote{ \url{www.kickstarter.com/profile/gotenna/created}}.
				
				Compared to the projects in Section \ref{subsubsec:lorameshchat} and Section \ref{subsubsec:meshtastic}, Sonnet and goTenna offer a more stable network, thanks to the fact that they can be considered finished products which have been thoroughly tested and produced on a bigger scale.

			\subsubsection{Mesh Wi-Fi}
					
				\textit{Mesh Wi-Fi}, or \textit{Whole Home Wi-Fi} systems, consists of a main router that connects directly to the main modem, and a series of satellite modules, or nodes, placed around the house for full Wi-Fi coverage.
				Each node serves as a hop point for other nodes in the system and are all part of a single wireless network and share the same SSID and password, unlike traditional Wi-Fi routers.
				Weakened signal or Wi-Fi dead spots of the latter are the result of physical obstructions (floor, doors, and walls).
				
				A modular mesh whole home Wi-Fi system is flexible and scalable, giving a customizable method of expanding Wi-Fi coverage without the need to add range extenders, which are certainly effective when it comes to increasing the router range, but they do so at the expense of Wi-Fi performance, which gets cut in half.
			
				\begin{figure}
					\centering
					\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{resources/img/chap4/wifi6}
					\caption{Wi-Fi 6 mesh nodes compared to Wi-Fi range extenders performance}
					\label{img:Wi-Fi6}
				\end{figure}
				
				Wi-Fi 6 is an evolution of 802.11ac technology, which promises increased throughput speeds (up to 9.6Gbps), less network congestion, greater client capacity, and better range performance thanks to the improved wireless technologies, including \textit{Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access} (\textit{OFDMA}).
				The latter improves overall throughput by breaking Wi-Fi channels into sub-channels, allowing up to 30 users to share a channel at the same time.
				
				Many important manufacturers for network hardware, like Netgear and Cisco, have already implemented such technology and functions in their products available not only for industrial purposes, but also for average users.
