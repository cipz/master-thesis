	\section{Future work}
	
		\subsection{Hardware improvements}
			
%			Note from the author, it must be taken in consideration that the device can run hot, an application of the device such as on a bike that is parked out in the sun may overheat the device.
%			On pycom's documentation it is written that the fipy can support temperatures up to x
%			Thus an interesting improvement could be to add a heatsink in order to lower the temperatures and improve the lifespan of the device
