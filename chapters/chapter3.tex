\chapter{Technologies}\label{chapter:technologies}

	To fully understand the project and the choices behind it, is worth taking a look at some backgrounds technology which can be useful to know before proceeding further into this thesis.
	In this chapter we describe DTNs, the notion of peer-to-peer and overlay networks.
