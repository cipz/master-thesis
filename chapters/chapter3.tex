	This chapter explains more in detail the underlying technologies of this project.
	Starting from the general definition of a network and the most common architectures, to radio technologies work and then micro-controllers.
	
\section{Fundamentals of network communication}

	Starting from the definition of a computer network by Paul E. Green, it is easy to understand its importance in today's society.
	Smartphones, personal computers and other interconnected devices have become omnipresent in modern society, in which people need to feel connected to each other via these devices.

	Not only they are used for fun, leisure and other social activities, but they allow connection to services such as online banking, government services and healthcare, that require a stable and secure connection among the systems that they use in order to provide a safe and sound experience for their users.
	All this to say, networks are everywhere underneath today's technology.
	There are no services or devices that can stand on their own without sharing data to other devices, to synchronize and provide a better user experience, to get updates from the manufacturer or simply to send a keep alive message.
	
	While this raw data is important for computers, people, the final users, process it to gain information, and this exchange of information from all around the world has brought radical changes many levels, from a cultural point of view to an economic point of view.
	The possibility of having a network of information exchange is the next step of globalization, which started with the exchange of goods among countries and now brings everyone together, allowing for a cultural exchange that lets people share and unite across the globe.
	
	This big network that is used to exchange information all around the world has a special name: Internet.
	% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access	
	% https://www.diplomacy.edu/blog/right-access-internet-countries-and-laws-proclaim-it/
	Many countries, such as Finland, Spain and Greece, have recognized the importance of this network and have given people the ''right to Internet access'', also known as the right to broadband or freedom to connect
	In these countries, service providers must be able to supply a mandatory minimum connection capability to all desiring home users in the regions of the country they serve.
	
	% http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/gg243376.html
	It is important to note that Internet, with a capital I, is a particular set of worldwide interconnected networks \cite{gg243376}, but a common network of networks is called internetwork, shortened by internet, with a lowercase i.
	
	Such distinction began in the 1980s and has been described in RFCs \footnote{\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc871}{RFC 871 (1982): A PERSPECTIVE ON THE ARPANET REFERENCE MODEL}}$^{,}$\footnote{\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc872}{RFC 872 (1982): TCP-ON-A-LAN}} by computer scientists that understood how ARPANET was expanding and the its dimensions were not enough anymore to accommodate the amount of data traveling from one computer to another.
	% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64
	At that time, computers such as the IBM 5150 and the infamous Commodore 64 were starting to become more and more available, even if highly priced, not only to companies and universities, but also to consumers that brought them in their households, especially with the advent of MS-DOSs, the dominant operating system throughout the 1980s and now open source \footnote{\url{https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS}}.
	
	As described by IBM in one of their technical books from the time, ''it is possible to divide the Internet such as the following groups of networks''\cite{gg243376}:
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Backbones: large and strategical data routes among core networks and routers that compose and connect the Internet;
		\item Regional networks that connect large facilities such as universities and colleges to each other;
		\item Commercial networks that provide to their subscribers access to the Internet;
		\item Local networks which run, for example, across a campus university;
	\end{itemize}

	\end{figure}
	\footnotetext{\url{https://www.infrapedia.com/app}}

	Given this increase of computers connecting to the Internet, there came the need for a revised structure that could better organize these components in a more robust, but also flexible, large network.

	With the advent of Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web (or WWW) in 1996 and the more accessible operating systems such as windows 95 and 98, even more people bought computers
	
	So much that the dot com bubble speculated on internet related companies

	Since everyone can connect to the Internet and access it's services, there is no need for the average user to understand what happens between his machine and the rest of the network, which means he only sees the information that is displayed to him without knowing where it arrives from or what path it took to arrive on his monitor.

	It is important to understand the difference between network architecture and network topology.
	
	A network architecture, as described by by Paul E. Green, ``is a complete definition of all the layers necessary to build the network''\cite{nla.cat-vn252493}.
	This is focused on the network software, which needs to be highly structure in order to allow for heterogeneous systems to communicate with each other.
	One example of network architecture is the ISO/OSI reference model, which is implemented by the TCP/IP stack of protocols.
	% Inserire immagine tcp/ip vs iso/osi vedi tenenbaum pag 42
	``A protocol is a set of agreements for interaction of two or more parties and is expressed by three components, syntax (e.g., a set of headers, a set of commands/responses), semantics (the actions and reactions that take place, including the exchange of messages), and timing, the sequencing and concurrency aspects of the protocol.''\cite{nla.cat-vn252493}.
	Different types of network use different architectures, based on the transmission medium and how well this performs (errors, speed, etc.)
	
	% https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/network-topology
	On the other hand, the network topology refers to the manner in which the links and nodes of a network are arranged to relate to each other.

	% COPIATO DA INTERNET: responsible for technical management of IETF activities and the Internet standards process
	Nowadays, the organization responsible for technical management of IETF activities and the Internet standards process is the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)\footnote{\url{https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/}}.
	It is necessary to have an organization looking over the Internet itself since it gives the regulations that allow all devices to interconnect with each other.
	
	Networks can be categorized based on their span.
	Instead, vendors apply the terms loosely to help customers distinguish among technologies.

\section{Radio technologies}\label{sec:section_two}
	
	% TODO RIVEDERE PERCHé HAI COPIATO TROPPA ROBA DA WIKIPEDIA
	% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_radio
	Although Guglielmo Marconi is usually credited as the inventor of radio due to the creation of the first commercially successful wireless communication system, many scientists before him have studied radio waves.
	
	The idea of a wireless telegraph had been around for a while before the establishment of radio-based communication and scientist tried to achieve it via electric conduction and electromagnetic induction
	
	The discovery of electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in the 1880s came after theoretical development on the connection between electricity and magnetism that started in the early 1800s.
		
	
	
	Other important experiments were made by Nikola Tesla
	
	Tesla invented the Tesla coil during efforts to develop a "wireless" lighting system	
	Tesla employed the Tesla coil in his efforts to achieve wireless power transmission, his lifelong dream. 
	
	
	In order to give a complete picture of radio transmitting technologies, it is important to make a distinction among the ones that are made for internal or nearby use vs the ones that are used for longer distances.
	
	100 years later, radio technology has massively evolved and is used on a daily basis
	
	
	
	With new transmission technologies, new network architectures have emerged
	
	Topologies that bring computation closer to the edge are also rising, since they allow for faster computation and they bring data closer to the user
	
	LAN MAN and WAN are not enough anymore to describe the new topologies
	
	An important distinction is now made by other factors such as POWER, COST and RANGE of the transmiter receiver

\section{Hardware (Microcontrollers)}

	Microcontrollers (or MCUs) are compact integrated circuits designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system.
	
	(MCU for microcontroller unit)
	
	Devices and CPUs have become smaller and more granular, allowing to have simple micro computers that need very little power resources, both computational and battery, that they can be used for very specific functions.
	
	Some examples can be:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item smog detector, which sounds an alarm when excess smog is sensed
		\item car range detector, that sends an alarm to the car's braking system when there is an object in front of it
		\item etc.
	\end{itemize}

		In 2005,

		They wanted a device that was simple, easy to connect to various things (such as relays, motors, and sensors), and easy to program. It also needed to be inexpensive, as students and artists aren’t known for having lots of spare cash. 
		
		They selected the AVR family of 8-bit microcontroller devices from Atmel and designed a self-contained circuit board with easy-to-use connections, wrote bootloader firmware for the microcontroller, and packaged it all into a simple integrated development environment (IDE) that used programs called “sketches.” The result was the Arduino.

	\subsection{Raspberry Pi}
		
		The Raspberry Pi is a tiny and affordable computer that you can use to learn programming through fun, practical projects
		
		When compared to the Arduino, the Raspberry pi offers more functionalities, since it's architecture 
				
		% https://www.electronicshub.org/raspberry-pi-vs-arduino/
		Raspberry Pi and Arduino are two very popular boards among electronics DIY builders, hobbyists and even professionals. Raspberry Pi and Arduino are quite different boards. While Arduino is aimed at quick programming and circuit prototyping, Raspberry Pi acts as a learning tool for Computer Programming 
				
		The Raspberry Pi was developed by Eben Upton at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom with the aim of teaching and improving programming skills of students in developing countries. While Arduino is a Microcontroller based development board, the Raspberry Pi is a Microprocessor (usually an ARM Cortex A Series) based board that acts as a computer.
		
		You can connect several peripherals like a Monitor (through HDMI or AV Port), Mouse and Keyboard (through USB), connect to internet (through Ethernet or Wi-Fi), add a Camera (through the dedicated Camera Interface), just like we do to our desktop computer.
		
		Since the entire Computer (the Processor, RAM, Storage, Graphics, Connectors, etc.) is sitting on a single Printed Circuit Board, the Raspberry Pi (and other similar boards) are called as Single Board Computers or SBC.
		
		Another important thing about Raspberry Pi is, as it is a Linux based Computer, you can develop software using several Programming Languages like C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, etc.

		A Pycom development board has considerably more I/O than a standard Arduino, but probably comparable to an Arduino Mega. Easy to program via Python. Good example code from Pycom. Small community. Low cost. Not at all comparable to Raspberry Pi in terms of software flexibility.

		A complete LoRa gateway (Pygate + WiPy + IP67 box + antenna) costs around \$100, which is pretty good. So far very stable, and it was easy to configure. There's a PoE unit, but I use WiFi (at my home).
