%After five and a half years, my life as a student at the University of Twente
%comes to an end. It has been a time full of adventures and personal growth,
%starting with a Bachelor in International Business Administration and finally
%finding my passion for IT Management and moving on to pursuing the MSc
%programme in Business Information Technology. This thesis is the result of nine
%months work and I am quite happy with how it turned out. Many people have
%contributed to this research over the past few months and I would like to thank
%some of them in the following:
%I would firstly like to thank my supervisors Klaas Sikkel and Jos van Hillegers-
%berg. I could not have wished for a better combination of supervisors. Both of
%them have always made time for me, supported all of my ideas and given me
%valuable feedback. Thank you for the interesting meetings and the hours you
%must have spent on reading my drafts.
%I would also like to thank my KPMG colleagues for their advice and interest in
%my thesis, especially my company supervisor Frank van Praat who always made
%time for me despite his busy schedule and my fellow internship companions
%who kept me motivated throughout both coffee breaks as well as stressful
%periods. I would also like to thank Henk Hendriks for pointing me towards this
%topic in the first place; this thesis has sparked my enthusiasm about Agile and
%DevOps even further and I thoroughly enjoyed working on it.
%I am also grateful to all people who made time to participate in the case studies
%and/or give me feedback on the results. Their insights and contributions mark
%the core of this thesis and this research would have been much less interesting
%without their participation.
%Most importantly, I would like to thank my friends and family, especially my
%parents and my boyfriend, for always supporting me throughout my studies.
%This thesis would not have been possible without you.
